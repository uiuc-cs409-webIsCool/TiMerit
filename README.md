# File Structure and Environment Setup

Please read this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51126472/how-to-organise-file-structure-of-backend-and-frontend-in-mern) for an introduction of the file structure of a MERN stack project. One thing to notice is that I have added `node_modules` directory into the .gitignore file so that installed packages won't be pushed to the remote. It seems as long as package json file is pushed, it will automatically synchronize the environment.


# Requirement of the project

1. Need to implement user authentication.
2. Understand the heat map of components distribution. (Slide 16 page 49)
3. Font type should not be too much. Body paragraph should be easy to read.
4. How is in experience level, your app will be different or improved from the current solutions. Looking for the motivation of design decision.
5. Do not have to use real data. We could manually enter data.
6. App competition is separated from grading.
